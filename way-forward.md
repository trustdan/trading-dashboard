# Way Forward: Alternative Frameworks for Trading Dashboard

Based on our experience with Tauri and the goal of creating a cross-platform desktop application with installers for Windows (.msi), macOS (.dmg), and Linux, here are some alternative frameworks worth considering.

## The Tauri Experience - A Cautionary Tale

Before discussing alternatives, it's worth reflecting on our experience with Tauri, which informed our evaluation criteria. What initially appeared to be a perfect match—lightweight, Rust-based, cross-platform—became a series of cascading configuration challenges:

1. **The Build Loop**: Our build process became a frustrating loop of:
   - Fix path configuration → break feature flags
   - Fix feature flags → break dependencies 
   - Fix dependencies → break path configuration

2. **Platform Inconsistencies**: Solutions that worked perfectly on one platform would inexplicably fail on another, with cryptic error messages providing little guidance.

3. **Command Context Sensitivity**: The same command would produce different results depending on which directory it was run from, with no clear documentation on the expected context.

4. **PowerShell vs. Bash Issues**: Windows-specific command syntax differences created additional barriers to smooth cross-platform development.

5. **Circular Dependencies**: Our project structure created circular dependencies that became increasingly difficult to untangle.

The cumulative effect was a development experience where solving one problem often created two more, like battling a hydra. This experience has made us particularly focused on build reliability and clear error messages in our evaluation of alternatives.

## Criteria for Evaluation

- **Cross-platform support**: Must reliably build for Windows, macOS, and possibly Linux
- **Installer generation**: Should generate professional installers (.msi, .dmg)
- **Language compatibility**: Preference for Rust, Go, Ruby backends
- **Frontend compatibility**: Support for Svelte/TypeScript
- **Build reliability**: Consistent and reliable build process with clear error messages
- **Path handling**: Sensible and consistent handling of relative paths
- **Command consistency**: Commands should work similarly across platforms
- **Error clarity**: Error messages should point to actual issues, not symptoms
- **Maintenance**: Active development community
- **Performance**: Good performance for real-time data visualization

## Top Framework Alternatives

- Desktop support still maturing
- Limited integration with Rust (would require FFI)

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use [Flutter Desktop](https://flutter.dev/desktop) framework
- Implement UI using Flutter widgets
- Use Dart FFI to call Rust code for performance-critical operations

### 3. Wails (Go + Web Technologies)

**Pros:**
- Similar to Tauri but with Go instead of Rust
- Reliable cross-platform building
- Smaller binaries than Electron
- Good Svelte support
- Simpler configuration than Tauri
- Native Go performance
- Better error messages and build reliability than Tauri
- More consistent path handling

**Cons:**
- Smaller community than Electron
- No direct Rust integration (would need to port backend to Go)

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use [Wails](https://wails.io/) with Svelte template
- Convert Rust backend to Go
- Keep Svelte frontend with minimal changes
- Use Wails build system for installers

### 4. Neutralinojs

**Pros:**
- Ultra-lightweight (compared to Electron)
- Support for web technologies (works with Svelte)
- Cross-platform
- Simple architecture

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem than alternatives
- Less mature tooling for installer creation
- Limited OS API access without extensions

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use [Neutralinojs](https://neutralino.js.org/) as the shell
- Maintain Svelte frontend
- Backend services written in desired language (Rust/Go)
- Bundle with neu-cli

### 5. Revamped Tauri Approach

**Pros:**
- Reuse existing Rust code
- Keep Svelte frontend
- Smaller binaries than Electron
- Potential for better performance

**Cons:**
- Already encountered configuration issues
- Requires careful planning to avoid the recursive issues of our previous attempt

**Implementation Approach:**
- Start with official Tauri template (`npx create-tauri-app@latest`)
- Simplify project structure
- Update to latest Tauri version
- Ensure all feature flags are properly configured
- Test build process early and frequently
- Maintain strict separation between frontend and backend concerns
- Create platform-specific build scripts

## Why Build Reliability Is Now Our Top Priority

Our Tauri experience has shifted our priorities. While we still value performance and efficient resource usage, the ability to reliably create distributable applications has become paramount. Every day spent fighting with build configurations is a day not spent improving the actual application.

This is why, despite its larger footprint, Electron has emerged as our leading candidate. Its mature build system, clear error messages, and reliable cross-platform support directly address the pain points we experienced with Tauri. The larger application size is a reasonable trade-off for development velocity and distribution reliability.

## Recommended Path

Based on requirements and preferences, here are the ranked recommendations:

1. **Electron with Svelte**: Most reliable path to cross-platform desktop installers with excellent Svelte support. While not as lightweight as other options, it has the most mature tooling for creating professional installers and the best developer experience.

2. **Wails**: A good middle ground if Go is acceptable for the backend. Similar to Tauri in concept but with potentially simpler configuration and build process.

3. **Revamped Tauri**: If keeping the Rust backend is critical, starting fresh with a standard Tauri template and simplified structure may resolve the issues encountered.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Prototype (1-2 weeks)
1. Create small proof-of-concept applications with Electron and Wails
2. Test the build and installer process on all target platforms
3. Evaluate developer experience and ease of implementation

### Phase 2: Migration (2-3 weeks)
1. Set up new project structure with chosen framework
2. Port core business logic from existing application
3. Recreate frontend with Svelte, reusing components where possible
4. Implement database layer

### Phase 3: Enhancement (2 weeks)
1. Add back all features from original application
2. Improve UX based on lessons learned
3. Implement automated build and testing process

### Phase 4: Distribution (1 week)
1. Finalize installer configurations for all platforms
2. Create automated release process
3. Test installation on clean systems

## Breaking the Recursive Cycle

Regardless of which framework we choose, we've learned that breaking the recursive cycle of configuration issues requires:

1. **Starting Simple**: Begin with minimal functionality and add complexity incrementally
2. **Testing Early**: Verify cross-platform builds from the very beginning
3. **Consistent Environments**: Ensure all developers use similar development environments
4. **Clear Documentation**: Document build processes and gotchas meticulously
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Maintain clear boundaries between frontend and backend code
6. **Platform-Specific Testing**: Test on all target platforms before major feature additions

## Conclusion

While Tauri offers an appealing vision of lightweight, secure cross-platform applications using Rust, our experience highlighted some practical challenges. Electron remains the most battle-tested solution for cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies, while Wails offers a compelling alternative if switching to Go is acceptable.

The decision ultimately depends on whether keeping the Rust backend is a hard requirement or if the reliability and maturity of the build system is the higher priority. Given our experience, we strongly lean toward prioritizing build reliability and developer experience, making Electron our current frontrunner despite its larger footprint.
