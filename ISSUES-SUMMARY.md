# Trading Dashboard Issues Summary

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Application Required Administrator Mode
- **Symptoms:** 
  - Application only runs when launched with administrator privileges
  - Data not saved between application launches
  - User settings lost on restart

- **Root Cause:** 
  - Database file (`trading.db`) was being saved in a relative path (`./data/trading.db`)
  - When installed to `C:\Program Files\TrustDan\Trading Dashboard`, standard users cannot write to this location
  - SQLite requires write permissions for its database file

- **Solution:**
  - Modified `pkg/database/database.go` to use `os.UserConfigDir()`
  - Database now saved in `%APPDATA%\TradingDashboard\data\trading.db`
  - This location is writable without administrator privileges

### 2. "Backend Unavailable" Error
- **Symptoms:**
  - UI would show "Backend Unavailable" message
  - Application would appear to start but not function

- **Root Cause:**
  - Go backend crashing due to SQLite initialization errors
  - Database connection failing because of missing `sqlite3.dll` or CGO issues

- **Solution:**
  - Improved build script to ensure `sqlite3.dll` is properly included
  - Added better detection of CGO compilation settings
  - Created debug tools to provide more detailed error messages

### 3. CGO_ENABLED=0 Compilation Issue
- **Symptoms:**
  - Error: "Binary was compiled with 'CGO_ENABLED=0', go-sqlite3 requires cgo to work"
  - Database functionality completely broken

- **Root Cause:**
  - Application was being compiled without CGO support
  - The `go-sqlite3` package requires CGO to be enabled during compilation

- **Solution:**
  - Modified build script to ensure `CGO_ENABLED=1` is set before compilation
  - Added verification to check if the compiled binary actually has CGO support
  - Created better documentation about CGO requirements

### 4. UI Freezing (Stock Rating and Calendar)
- **Symptoms:**
  - Clicking on Stock Rating causes UI to freeze
  - Cannot navigate between different sections
  - Calendar feature may not work correctly

- **Root Cause:**
  - Potentially JavaScript errors in the frontend code
  - Possible communication issues between frontend and backend
  - Could be related to database access problems

- **Solution:**
  - Added debug build option (`.\build-trading.bat --debug`)
  - Enabled developer tools in debug builds
  - Created detailed logging in debug mode
  - Updated documentation with instructions to diagnose UI issues

## Tools and Scripts Created

### 1. Build Scripts
- **build-trading.bat**
  - Sets proper environment variables (`CGO_ENABLED=1`, `CC=gcc`)
  - Downloads SQLite DLL if missing
  - Supports `--debug` flag for developer builds
  - Verifies CGO was correctly enabled

### 2. Debug Tools
- **run-debug.bat**
  - Runs application with enhanced logging
  - Captures detailed output for troubleshooting
  - Ensures SQLite DLL is in the correct location

- **direct-run.bat**
  - Simple script to run the application with minimal environment setup
  - Sets `CGO_ENABLED=1` and launches the executable

### 3. Installation Fix
- **fix-installed-app.bat**
  - Repairs existing installations
  - Adds missing SQLite DLL
  - Creates correct launcher script with environment variables
  - Creates desktop shortcut to the fixed launcher

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Include SQLite DLL in Application Bundle**
   - Consider embedding the SQLite DLL directly in the Go binary using techniques like go-bindata
   - Or ensure it's properly copied during installation

2. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Add more user-friendly error messages for common issues
   - Implement automatic recovery mechanisms for database connection failures

3. **UI Improvements**
   - If UI freezing persists, investigate frontend code for potential issues
   - Consider adding a loading indicator during database operations
   - Add explicit error messages in the UI for database issues

4. **Installer Enhancements**
   - Modify the installer to add a proper start menu entry with required environment variables
   - Consider adding an auto-update mechanism

5. **Testing**
   - Create automated tests to verify database functionality
   - Test installation process on various Windows versions
   - Test with and without administrator privileges
