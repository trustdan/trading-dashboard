Here's a comprehensive and structured Gherkin/Cucumber test plan with clear pseudo-code and explanatory notes suitable for a Wails (Go backend) and Svelte frontend application, including your three primary dashboards:  

- **Risk Management (RM) Dashboard**
- **Stock-Rating Dashboard**
- **Live Calendar with Historical Trades**

# Complete Gherkin Feature File and Plan

## Feature: Risk Management Dashboard

```gherkin
Feature: Risk Management Dashboard
  To manage daily trading risk
  As a trader
  I want to assess my emotional and psychological state daily

  Scenario: Trader assesses daily emotional state
    Given the trader opens the Risk Management Dashboard
    When the trader sets sliders for:
      | Factor                 | Range          |
      | Emotional State        | -3 to +3       |
      | FOMO Level             | -3 to +3       |
      | Market Bias            | -3 to +3       |
      | Physical Condition     | -3 to +3       |
      | Recent P&L Impact      | -3 to +3       |
    Then the dashboard calculates an overall risk score
    And the dashboard visually displays the recommended position size based on risk score
```

### Pseudo-code:

```javascript
// Svelte Frontend Component
RiskDashboard.svelte
- sliders: { emotional, fomo, bias, physical, pnl }
- calculateRiskScore(sliders)
- displayRiskScoreVisualization(score)

// Go Backend (Wails)
CalculateRiskScore(sliders []int) int:
    score = sum(sliders) / len(sliders)
    return score
```

### Plain-English Explanation:
The trader sets daily psychological assessments via interactive sliders. The system calculates and visually presents an overall risk score and corresponding recommended position size.

## Feature: Stock Rating Dashboard

```gherkin
Feature: Stock Rating Dashboard
  To identify the most promising trading opportunities
  As a trader
  I want to rate market, sectors, and individual stocks

  Scenario: Trader rates overall market and sector sentiment
    Given the trader accesses the Stock Rating Dashboard
    When the trader sets a sentiment slider for:
      | Entity          | Range        |
      | Overall Market  | -3 to +3     |
      | Sector          | -3 to +3     |
    Then the sentiment is visually displayed and stored in the local database

  Scenario: Trader rates individual stocks with patterns
    Given the trader is on the Stock Rating Dashboard
    When the trader selects an individual stock
    And sets the sentiment slider (-3 to +3)
    And selects a chart pattern from a dropdown:
      | Pattern Choices |
      | High Base       |
      | Low Base        |
      | Ascending Triangle |
      | Descending Triangle |
      | Bull Pullback   |
      | Bear Rally      |
      | Double-Top      |
      | Cup-and-Handle  |
    Then the stock receives an enthusiasm rating score
    And the score is visually displayed and saved

  Scenario: Enthusiasm rating calculation
    Given trader rated a stock sentiment at "+2"
    And selected "Ascending Triangle" as chart pattern
    When the dashboard calculates enthusiasm
    Then the enthusiasm rating should reflect:
      - Base sentiment points
      - Bonus points from pattern rarity and effectiveness
```

### Pseudo-code:

```javascript
// Svelte Frontend Component
StockRating.svelte
- slider: sentiment
- dropdown: patternSelect
- calculateEnthusiasm(sentiment, pattern)

// Go Backend (Wails)
EnthusiasmRating(sentiment int, pattern string) int:
    patternPoints = {
        "High Base": 2, "Low Base": 2,
        "Ascending Triangle": 3, "Descending Triangle": 3,
        "Bull Pullback": 2, "Bear Rally": 2,
        "Double-Top": 3, "Cup-and-Handle": 4
    }
    return sentiment + patternPoints[pattern]
```

### Plain-English Explanation:
Traders rate market, sectors, and stocks on sentiment and chart patterns, which calculates a numerical enthusiasm rating to highlight promising trades.

## Feature: Live Calendar with Historical Trades

```gherkin
Feature: Trade Calendar & History Tracking
  To maintain and review a structured history of trades
  As a trader
  I want a calendar view tracking weekly trades and positions

  Scenario: Trader views current positions calendar
    Given the trader navigates to the Live Calendar
    Then the dashboard displays a 4-6 week rolling calendar
    And positions entered are visible and color-coded by sector

  Scenario: Trader enters a new trade position
    Given the trader is viewing the calendar
    When the trader selects a date on the calendar
    And inputs a new position with:
      - Security ticker symbol
      - Sector categorization
      - Entry price
      - Notes/comments
    Then the position is saved and immediately visible on the calendar

  Scenario: Calendar automatically rolls forward
    Given it is a new trading week
    When the trader opens the calendar
    Then the oldest week disappears from the default view
    And a new week is appended at the end, maintaining a rolling calendar

  Scenario: Trader searches historical trades
    Given trader accesses the Historical Trades Table beneath calendar
    When trader enters search query (ticker, sector, or date range)
    Then matching past trades are displayed in a sortable table
```

### Pseudo-code:

```javascript
// Svelte Frontend Component
Calendar.svelte
- displayRollingCalendar(currentWeek, positions)
- addTrade(date, ticker, sector, price, notes)
- searchHistoricalTrades(query)

// Go Backend (Wails)
Trade struct { date, ticker, sector, price, notes }
AddTrade(trade Trade):
    save trade in SQLite DB

GetHistoricalTrades(query string) []Trade:
    query DB for matching trades, return sorted list
```

### Plain-English Explanation:
This calendar gives traders a live weekly overview of positions, with entries maintained automatically as weeks advance, plus a searchable, historical trade log.

## Technical Notes & Recommendations for Implementation:

- **Frontend:**
  - Create reusable Svelte components (`Slider`, `Dropdown`, `Calendar`) to simplify UI.
  - Emphasize visual feedback for clarity (e.g., color-coding sectors, clear score displays).

- **Backend (Go + Wails):**
  - Clearly defined Go backend API functions for each feature.
  - Use embedded SQLite with straightforward schemas for fast local storage and retrieval.
  - Ensure backend calculates scores accurately and updates immediately on UI.

---

## Recommended Database Schema (SQLite):

```sql
CREATE TABLE risk_assessments (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  date TEXT,
  emotional INTEGER,
  fomo INTEGER,
  bias INTEGER,
  physical INTEGER,
  pnl INTEGER,
  overall_score INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE stock_ratings (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  date TEXT,
  ticker TEXT,
  market_sentiment INTEGER,
  sector_sentiment INTEGER,
  stock_sentiment INTEGER,
  pattern TEXT,
  enthusiasm_rating INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE trades (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  entry_date TEXT,
  ticker TEXT,
  sector TEXT,
  entry_price REAL,
  notes TEXT
);
```

## Summary of Development Steps:

- **Week 1**: Scaffold initial Wails + Svelte project; setup database schema and backend endpoints.
- **Week 2**: Implement RM dashboard UI/backend logic.
- **Week 3**: Stock-rating UI/backend logic and scoring algorithm.
- **Week 4**: Calendar implementation with position tracking.
- **Week 5**: Historical trade table and search features.
- **Week 6**: Polishing, testing, and deployment preparations.
